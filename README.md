# Intermediate Redux fun project

Form a team of 2 to 3 people.

Build a chat app, incorporate Redux for state management. 

An example is provided for you in `src/App.js` however it does not use Redux and is lacking a message viewer. 

Note: Your message listener callback `hear()` will not be fired for messages you send, only messages from others. 

*Note:* Everyone is in the same channel

*Note:* No there's no security

*Note:* Yes you can steal someone elses nickname... have fun!

### Hackers

If you want to go crazy take the connection object and have a look at [SendBird's docs](https://docs.sendbird.com/javascript). The `connection` object is effectively `sb`.
